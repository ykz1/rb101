greeting = 'Hello'

loop do
  greeting = 'Hi'
  break
end

puts greeting

# Question Prompt:
# Examine the code below. The last line outputs the string 'Hi' rather than the string 'Hello'. Explain what is happening here and identify the underlying principle that this demonstrates.

# Answer below

=begin

First, the local variable `greeting` is assigned to the string `'Hello'`. Next, a `loop` method is invoked with a `do..end` block, which creates its own inner scope. From within the block, the outer scope local variable `greeting` is accessible, and is reassigned to a new string `'Hi'` on line 4. The `loop` iterates one time before terminating with the `break` statement on line 5. Finally, the `puts` method is invoked on line 8, with `greeting`'s value, which is now `'Hi'`, passed as an argumentâ€”this is what ultimately gets printed to the screen. 

This block of code demonstrates that local variables initialized in an outer scope are accessible within an inner scope.
